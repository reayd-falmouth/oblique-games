        "detailed_description": "Serpent's Pulse reimagines the traditional Snake game by introducing a rhythm-based gameplay mechanic inspired by the oblique strategy 'Ask your body'. In this innovative version, players control a snake that moves to the beat of a pulsating soundtrack. Each beat represents a moment when the snake can change direction or speed, requiring players to sync their actions with the rhythm. The game challenges players to navigate through a vibrant, dynamic environment, collecting items to grow longer while avoiding obstacles and their own tail. The integration of rhythmic movement creates a meditative yet challenging experience, as players must feel the pulse and react instinctively to the music's tempo.",
