In this game, players must develop their civilizations from the ground up, advancing through different eras and making strategic decisions to outmaneuver opponents. However, the game introduces a challenging twist: communication is severely limited. Players must navigate diplomacy, trade, and alliances without the use of traditional dialogue options, relying on non-verbal cues and actions to convey intentions. This innovative mechanic requires players to think creatively and strategically, fostering a new level of immersion and challenge in the pursuit of building a thriving empire.', 'tags': ['strategy', 'empire-building', 'turn-based', 'diplomacy', 'non-verbal communication', 'civilization', 'innovation']}",
