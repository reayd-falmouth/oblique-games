        "detailed_description": "Dual Horizons challenges players to navigate a procedurally generated galaxy, commanding a starship and its crew through a series of strategic encounters. Inspired by FTL: Faster Than Light, the game introduces a unique twist by implementing the oblique strategy 'A line has two sides.' Players must manage two ships simultaneously, each on opposite sides of a cosmic divide, making strategic decisions that affect both vessels. The dual perspectives require players to balance resources, crew morale, and tactical maneuvers while facing threats from alien factions and environmental hazards. As players progress, they must uncover the mysteries of the galaxy, forge alliances, and ultimately decide the fate of both ships as they converge on a singular horizon.",
