        "detailed_description": "Dual Axis Gomoku modifies the traditional Gomoku experience by introducing the concept of 'A line has two sides.' In this version, players not only aim to connect five pieces in a row but must also consider their opponent's potential moves from both axes. The game features a clear grid where players can place their pieces to either build their own line or thwart their opponent's strategy. The dual-axis mechanic adds complexity and depth, forcing players to anticipate moves in both horizontal and vertical perspectives, engaging them in a rich tactical battle. Aimed at casual and competitive gamers alike, Dual Axis Gomoku challenges players to rethink their strategies and consider their opponent's options more critically.",
