        "detailed_description": "Idiosyncratic Mechanics Unified Pulse Monotonous Journey Living Engines is a creative collection of video games that have been reimagined through the lens of Brian Eno's oblique strategies. Each game in the compendium takes on a unique twist by embracing mechanical idiosyncrasies, where peculiar elements are given structured, machine-like qualities. The 'Unified Pulse' aspect ensures that each game focuses on a single rhythmic element, whether it be a beat, note, or riff, creating a cohesive and unified experience. 'Monotonous Journey' explores the concept of doing something boring, challenging players to find intrigue and depth in seemingly mundane tasks. Lastly, 'Living Engines' introduces (organic) machinery, blending natural and mechanical elements to create vibrant, living game worlds. This compendium offers a fresh and artistic take on video games, inviting players to experience familiar genres in innovative and thought-provoking ways.",
