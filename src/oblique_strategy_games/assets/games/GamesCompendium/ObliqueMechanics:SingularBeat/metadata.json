        "detailed_description": "Oblique Mechanics: Singular Beat is a creative and experimental video game compendium that reinterprets classic games through the lens of Brian Eno's oblique strategies. Each game within the collection is transformed by the directive to 'Mechanicalize something idiosyncratic', resulting in gameplay that emphasizes mechanical precision and quirks. Additionally, the strategy 'Lowest common denominator check - single beat - single note - single riff' is applied, leading to a minimalist audio-visual style where each game is accompanied by a singular, repetitive beat or motif. This creates a meditative and focused gaming experience, inviting players to explore the familiar in entirely new ways. From rhythm games to puzzles, each entry in the compendium offers a unique take on simplicity and complexity, challenging players to find depth in minimalism.",
