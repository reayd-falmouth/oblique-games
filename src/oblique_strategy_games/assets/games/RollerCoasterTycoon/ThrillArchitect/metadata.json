In this game, you take on the role of a park manager tasked with designing and running a successful amusement park. However, the rides and attractions in your park can change roles, offering unexpected experiences to your visitors. Imagine a roller coaster that transforms into a water ride or a carousel that becomes a live theater stage. As you build and expand your park, you'll need to strategically decide how and when to switch the roles of your attractions to maximize visitor satisfaction and profits. With a variety of rides, shops, and facilities at your disposal, along with the ability to innovate by changing their functions, Thrill Architect challenges you to think creatively and adaptively to create the ultimate theme park experience.",
