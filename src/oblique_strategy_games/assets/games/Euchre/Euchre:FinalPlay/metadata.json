In this game, players must carefully plan their moves, listing all potential strategies before executing the least conventional option. This rule adds a layer of unpredictability and requires players to think outside the box, creating a dynamic and challenging experience. The game maintains the core mechanics of Euchre, such as forming partnerships, selecting trump suits, and winning tricks, but the added strategic layer ensures that no two games are alike.",
