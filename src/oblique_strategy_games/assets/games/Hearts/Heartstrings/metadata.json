This version introduces a creative twist inspired by the oblique strategy 'Assemble some of the instruments in a group and treat the group'. Players must form temporary alliances to manage their cards as a group, adding layers of strategic depth and collaboration. The game maintains the core mechanics of 'Hearts' while encouraging players to think collectively, fostering a unique social dynamic and making each round unpredictable and engaging.",
