        "detailed_description": "'Hearts: Pause Edition' is a refreshing take on the traditional card game 'Hearts', designed to incorporate the oblique strategy of 'Take a break'. This version not only challenges players with the familiar objective of avoiding penalty points by not taking hearts or the queen of spades but also introduces a new mechanic where players must periodically pause the game. These mandatory breaks add a strategic layer, as players must plan their moves while also managing the pace of the game. During these pauses, players have the opportunity to reflect on their strategies, discuss tactics with fellow players, or simply relax, enhancing the social and mental aspects of the game.",
