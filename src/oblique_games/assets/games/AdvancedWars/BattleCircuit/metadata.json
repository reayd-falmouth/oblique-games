Players command various military units across grid-based maps, engaging in tactical battles to outmaneuver and defeat their opponents. The game introduces a unique twist with the 'short circuit' mechanic, allowing players to disrupt enemy communications and temporarily disable their units, adding an extra layer of strategic depth.
