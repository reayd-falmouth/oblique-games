This turn-based city building game challenges individuals to construct and manage a city beneath the waves while incorporating the enchanting sounds of children's voices as an integral game mechanic. Set in a beautifully crafted aquatic world, elements like ocean currents, marine flora, and fauna play critical roles in resource management and sustainability. Players must balance growth with ethical practices, ensuring the preservation of the oceanâ€™s ecosystems. Additionally, each level presents a puzzle where players use children's choral voices to influence sea creatures, advance technologies, and maintain harmony with the natural environment. This innovative use of sound not only engages players but also teaches important lessons about sustainability and respect for the ocean.",
