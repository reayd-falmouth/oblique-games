        "detailed_description": "Silent Ascent takes the classic 'Snakes and Ladders' board game and transforms it into a unique auditory experience. Players move across a board that is shrouded in darkness, requiring them to rely on subtle sound cues to guide their progress. The game introduces a novel mechanic where ladders emit gentle, uplifting sounds, while snakes produce ominous, descending tones. The environment is set in a large, echoing chamber, enhancing the auditory clues and adding a layer of tension and immersion. Players must listen carefully to advance, using their ears rather than their eyes to find their path to victory. The atmosphere is one of quiet anticipation, encouraging players to be patient and strategic as they ascend towards the finish line.",
