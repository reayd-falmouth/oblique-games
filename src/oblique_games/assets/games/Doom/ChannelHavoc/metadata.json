Players find themselves in a hellish world filled with demons and must use their arsenal to survive. The twist comes from the audio system, where players must pay attention to the left, right, and center audio channels to detect enemy movements and environmental cues. This requires players to not only rely on visual cues but also to strategically use sound to anticipate and react to threats, creating a more immersive and challenging experience. With retro-inspired graphics and modern sound design, Channel Havoc offers a fresh take on the beloved FPS genre.",
