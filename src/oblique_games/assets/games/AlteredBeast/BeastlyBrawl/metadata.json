        "detailed_description": "In Beastly Brawl, players take on the role of a resurrected warrior on a mission to rescue a kidnapped goddess. Inspired by the classic 'Altered Beast', this version adds a unique twist with the oblique strategy 'Be dirty'. The game features grimy, polluted environments where players must fight through hordes of grotesque creatures. As they progress, players collect power-ups that allow them to transform into various beasts, each with their own special abilities and combat styles. The game emphasizes a raw, visceral combat experience with a focus on using the environment to your advantage. Players will navigate through sewers, junkyards, and other unclean settings, adding a layer of strategy as they balance their beastly powers with the need to adapt to the filthy surroundings.",
