As you stack and clear lines, the blocks don't just vanish instantly; they gradually fade away, adding a new layer of strategy. Players must consider the timing of fades to optimize their space and score. The game challenges you to adapt to the ever-changing visibility of the blocks, making each move more critical and engaging. The fading system is designed to create a visually captivating experience while maintaining the addictive gameplay of the original Tetris.",
