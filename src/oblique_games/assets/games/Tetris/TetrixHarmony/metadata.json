As blocks fall and lines clear, players must ensure the notes create a harmonious melody. The challenge lies not only in fitting the blocks but also in tuning them appropriately to maintain a pleasant auditory experience. This creative twist requires players to think about both spatial and auditory elements, offering a fresh and engaging puzzle experience.",
