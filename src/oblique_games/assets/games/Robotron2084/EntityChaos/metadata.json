Players navigate a surreal, ever-shifting landscape, where both allies and adversaries are indistinct, challenging players to adapt to constant uncertainty. The game's aesthetics are deliberately abstract, with visuals and soundscapes that blur the line between friend and foe, creating a unique experience that requires players to rely on intuition and reflexes. The aim is to survive waves of enigmatic entities that morph and blend into the environment, presenting a continuous test of perception and reaction.",
