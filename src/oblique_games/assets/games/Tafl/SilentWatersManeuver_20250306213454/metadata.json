Players navigate underwater realms as fish clans, trying to outmaneuver opponents while maintaining balance in the ecosystem. The game uses the oblique strategy 'Listen in total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly,' to incorporate stealth tactics and strategic listening. Each move must consider the harmony of the underwater world, as overfishing or aggressive expansion can disrupt the ecosystem. The ambient sound design immerses players in the quiet, serene depths, challenging them to make thoughtful and sustainable choices.",
