Players must align five stones of their color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. However, in a unique twist, players can swap the roles of their stones, allowing them to change a stone's function, such as turning an attacking piece into a defensive tool or vice versa. This added layer of strategy challenges players to think ahead and adapt their tactics dynamically. The game's minimalist design and intuitive interface make it accessible to both newcomers and veterans of strategy games.",
