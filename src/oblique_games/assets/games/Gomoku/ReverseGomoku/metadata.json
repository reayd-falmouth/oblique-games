        "detailed_description": "Reverse Gomoku offers a unique twist on the classic board game Gomoku. In traditional Gomoku, players compete to be the first to create an unbroken line of five stones. However, in Reverse Gomoku, the strategy is inverted - the objective is to force your opponent into forming a line of five. Players take turns placing stones on the board, strategically planning their moves to corner their opponent into completing a line first. It's a psychological battle that tests reverse thinking, requiring you to anticipate and manipulate the opponent's moves. This variant encourages players to rethink traditional strategies and adapt to an opposite approach in gameplay.",
