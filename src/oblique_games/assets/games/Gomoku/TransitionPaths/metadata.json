Players must navigate through different sections of the board, each with unique properties and rules. As the game progresses, players strategically plan their moves not only to align five stones in a row but also to exploit the transitions between different board sections. This added layer of complexity challenges players to think several steps ahead, making every match a new strategic puzzle.",
