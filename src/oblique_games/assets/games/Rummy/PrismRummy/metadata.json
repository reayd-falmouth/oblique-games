In this game, players not only focus on forming sets and runs but also on creating combinations that align with different colors of a spectrum. Each card is associated with a color, and players can earn bonus points by completing color-specific objectives. The game introduces new strategic layers as players must analyze the 'spectrum' of their hands and adapt their strategies accordingly. The colorful and dynamic gameplay of Prism Rummy challenges players to think beyond the usual card combinations and engage with a visually stimulating spectrum of possibilities.",
