The game challenges them to make ethical decisions about the marine environment, protecting it from exploitation while harvesting resources sustainably. The innovative twist of combining exploration with ethical dilemmas makes players face choices where they can pursue both options, blending preservation with resource collection to maintain harmony. The game features a rich narrative, allowing players to affect the underwater world profoundly with their decisions while enjoying the vast, open-world adventure.",
