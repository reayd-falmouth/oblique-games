In this version of chess, each piece is represented by a specific note or melody sung by children's voices. As players move their pieces across the board, they create a harmonious soundscape, turning strategic gameplay into a musical performance. The game maintains traditional chess rules but adds an enchanting layer of audio, making it an immersive experience for players who enjoy both music and strategy.",
