        "detailed_description": "Role Reversal Morris reinvents the timeless board game Nine Men's Morris by incorporating the oblique strategy 'Change instrument roles.' In this variant, players not only aim to form mills and remove opponent pieces, but they also switch roles with each turn. This means that players must adapt their strategies dynamically, as they play both offensive and defensive roles interchangeably. The board is the same as traditional Nine Men's Morris, featuring a grid with 24 intersections where players place their pieces. However, the role-swapping mechanic adds a layer of complexity, requiring players to think ahead and anticipate their opponent's moves while planning their own. This game challenges players to be versatile and strategic, offering a fresh take on a classic game.",
