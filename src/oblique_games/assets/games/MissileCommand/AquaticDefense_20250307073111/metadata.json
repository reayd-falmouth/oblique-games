        "detailed_description": "Aquatic Defense transports players to a vibrant underwater world, where the goal is to protect marine environments from harmful pollutants and destructive debris. Players control various aquatic creatures, each with unique abilities, to intercept incoming threats, such as oil spills, plastic waste, and invasive species. The game encourages players to work counterintuitively by sometimes having them redirect threats to less critical areas, sacrificing short-term gains for long-term aquatic health. Emphasizing ethics and sustainability, Aquatic Defense challenges players to think critically about resource management, ecosystem balance, and the impact of their actions on oceanic habitats. Suitable for all skill levels, the game offers a rewarding experience that highlights the importance of protecting our marine environments.",
