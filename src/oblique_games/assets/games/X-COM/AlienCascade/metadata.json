        "detailed_description": "Alien Cascade challenges players to lead an elite defense force against relentless alien invasions. Inspired by classic 'X-COM' mechanics, the game introduces the unique concept of 'Cascades', where each alien wave triggers a series of unpredictable events that affect the battlefield and strategy. Players must adapt to these cascading events, using a combination of tactical combat, resource management, and strategic planning to protect Earth. As the commander, you will recruit and train soldiers, research alien technology, and build a network of bases to defend against the ever-escalating alien threat. The game's dynamic environments and evolving scenarios ensure no two campaigns are alike, demanding constant adaptation and strategic foresight.",
