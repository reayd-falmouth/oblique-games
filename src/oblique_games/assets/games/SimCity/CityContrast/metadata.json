Unlike traditional city-building games, City Contrast emphasizes the importance of differences and diversity within the urban landscape. Players must strategically zone areas, manage resources, and balance the needs of contrasting neighborhoods. The game encourages players to create diverse districts with unique characteristics, fostering an environment where differences are celebrated and leveraged for growth. Challenges arise as players navigate the complexities of maintaining harmony between varied communities, ensuring that each district's uniqueness contributes to the overall success of the city.",
