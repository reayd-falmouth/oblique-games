Players control a serpent that must navigate around the edges of the playing field. The game challenges players to maintain a slow and steady pace as they guide the serpent around the perimeter, avoiding obstacles and collecting items to grow longer. The key to success is patience and strategic movement, as rushing will lead to collisions and game over. The game introduces new elements such as moving barriers and timed challenges to keep players engaged and test their skills.",
