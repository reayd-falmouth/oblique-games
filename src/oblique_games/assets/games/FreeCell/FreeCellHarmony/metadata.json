        "detailed_description": "FreeCell Harmony takes the traditional FreeCell card game and introduces a unique twist inspired by the oblique strategy: 'Is the tuning appropriate?'. In this version, players are challenged not only to solve the card puzzle but also to adjust the game's parameters for optimal play. Each game begins with a randomized deck, and players must strategically place cards in the free cells to ultimately sort all cards into their respective suits. However, the twist lies in the player's ability to modify certain game parameters, such as the number of free cells available or the complexity of the card layout, to achieve a harmonious balance. The game encourages players to experiment with different configurations, fostering a deeper understanding of strategy and adaptability. With its serene design and thoughtful gameplay, FreeCell Harmony offers both classic card enthusiasts and strategic thinkers a refreshing challenge.",
