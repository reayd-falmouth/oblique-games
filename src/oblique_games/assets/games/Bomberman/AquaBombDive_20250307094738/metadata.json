Set in vibrant underwater arenas inspired by coral reefs, sunken ships, and riverbeds, players must strategically place bombs to clear paths, defeat opponents, and safely dispose of hazardous materials. The game encourages deep exploration and mindfulness about marine life, integrating ethical choices that impact your surroundings. Power-ups include sustainable gadgets like coral shields and fish-friendly sonar pulses. Players must 'breathe more deeply', taking considered, slower movements to avoid causing unintended harm to the delicate underwater ecosystems.
