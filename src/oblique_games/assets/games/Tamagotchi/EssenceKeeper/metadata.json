In this game, players are tasked with caring for a simple yet captivating virtual pet, known as an 'Essence.' The gameplay revolves around maintaining the Essence's basic needs, such as feeding, cleaning, and ensuring its happiness. As the game progresses, players must decide which elements are truly important for the Essence's wellbeing, gradually removing features that seem less vital. This strategic reduction challenges players to discover what truly matters in the relationship with their virtual companion, creating a deeply engaging and thoughtful experience.",
