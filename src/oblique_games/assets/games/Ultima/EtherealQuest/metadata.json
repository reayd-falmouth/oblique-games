        "detailed_description": "Ethereal Quest is a role-playing game inspired by the classic 'Ultima' series, but with a unique twist inspired by the oblique strategy 'Disconnect from desire'. In this game, players are not driven by the usual goals of wealth, power, or fame. Instead, they embark on a spiritual journey, seeking enlightenment and understanding in a world filled with mystery and subtle beauty. The game emphasizes exploration, self-reflection, and the pursuit of knowledge over traditional RPG elements. Players will encounter a variety of characters, each with their own stories and lessons, and will solve puzzles that challenge their perceptions and encourage them to let go of material desires. The world of Ethereal Quest is vast and open, inviting players to wander and discover at their own pace, free from the constraints of typical quest objectives.",
