In this version, players must navigate two simultaneous pathways with their pieces, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities. The game introduces a strategic layer where players, when faced with a choice, must attempt to do both actions, as inspired by Dieter Roth's oblique strategy. This duality adds depth and complexity, requiring players to think ahead and adapt their strategies on the fly. The game maintains the original's competitive edge while offering new, exciting dynamics that challenge conventional gameplay.\",\n 'tags': ['Board Game', 'Strategy', 'Multiplayer', 'Parcheesi', 'Innovative', 'Dual Paths', 'Decision-Making', 'Adaptation', 'Family Game']}",
