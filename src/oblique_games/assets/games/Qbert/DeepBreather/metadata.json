        "detailed_description": "Deep Breather is a unique reimagining of the classic arcade game Q*bert. In this version, players control a character navigating a pyramid of cubes, with the objective of changing the color of each cube by landing on them. The twist in Deep Breather is the integration of a breathing mechanic. Players must time their moves with deep breaths, which influence the character's jump height and distance. Breathing deeply allows for longer jumps, while shallow breaths result in shorter hops. This adds an extra layer of strategy, as players must coordinate their breathing patterns with their movements to avoid obstacles and enemies. The game features vibrant visuals, challenging levels, and a calming soundtrack designed to encourage rhythmic breathing.",
