Inspired by classic social games like 'Habbo Hotel', Echo Realm adds a unique twist by incorporating the concept of 'Feedback recordings into an acoustic situation'. This means that players can record sounds and voices within the game, which then influence and alter the acoustic environment of their virtual spaces. As players interact, their recorded feedback loops create dynamic and evolving soundscapes, enhancing the social and creative aspects of the game. The game offers a blend of social interaction, creative expression, and acoustic experimentation, making each player's experience unique and immersive.",
