        "detailed_description": "Aqua Clash is a fighting game where players embody various aquatic creatures in intense battles under the sea. Each character, inspired by marine life, comes with unique abilities emphasizing ethical and sustainable practices within their environment. The game introduces an innovative mechanic where players must 'record' their combos and then 'feed' these recordings back into the game as they fight, simulating an acoustic environment where sound waves play a crucial role in the combat strategy. This integrates the theme of feedback for sustainability, as players must adapt to the reverberations of their previous actions to succeed. The visual theme emphasizes the beauty of the ocean and the need for sustainable interaction with its ecosystems.",
