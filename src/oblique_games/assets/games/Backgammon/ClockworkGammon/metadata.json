        "detailed_description": "Clockwork Gammon is a unique take on the traditional board game Backgammon, where players navigate their pieces around the board to bear them off before their opponent. This version introduces a mechanical twist by 'mechanicalizing' the idiosyncratic elements of the game. The dice rolls and piece movements are automated with clockwork mechanisms, adding a layer of strategy as players must anticipate the mechanical patterns and time their moves accordingly. This blend of classic gameplay and mechanical innovation offers a fresh and engaging challenge for both Backgammon enthusiasts and newcomers.",
