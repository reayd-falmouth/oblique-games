The game integrates elements of sustainability and ethics by introducing concepts such as ocean conservation, the impact of pollution, and the importance of marine biodiversity. Special board spaces trigger events related to these themes, creating an immersive and educational experience. The gameplay is designed to be accessible to developers and players of all skill levels, providing a creative platform to explore and understand the delicate balance of ocean ecosystems. To address the oblique strategy, 'Is there something missing?', developers incorporated a unique mechanic where players must balance their advancement with the overall health of the ocean, adding depth to strategy and decisions. This game aims to not only entertain but also to provoke thought and inspire positive change towards ocean conservation.",
