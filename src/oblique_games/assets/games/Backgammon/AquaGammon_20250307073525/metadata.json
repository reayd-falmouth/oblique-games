        "detailed_description": "AquaGammon reimagines the traditional game of Backgammon with a vibrant aquatic theme. Players navigate their pieces, represented as sea creatures, across a board designed to resemble the ocean floor. In an innovative twist inspired by the Oblique Strategy 'Change instrument roles,' the traditional roles of dice and pieces are altered. Dice are replaced with unique sea currents that influence movement, and players deploy their ocean guardian pieces to strategically control these currents. Through gameplay, AquaGammon integrates educational elements on ocean sustainability and marine life ethics. Players encounter challenges such as pollution and overfishing, which they must overcome using strategies that promote a healthy oceanic ecosystem. Perfect for game jammers of all skill levels, AquaGammon combines whimsy with a meaningful ecological message.",
