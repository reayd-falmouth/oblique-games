        "detailed_description": "Echo Drift offers a fresh take on the classic game of backgammon set within the serene depths of the ocean. Players navigate their game pieces, represented by sea turtles, across a vivid, underwater board resembling a coral reef. The game integrates elements of sustainability, urging players to collect 'eco points' by making sustainable moves or capturing opponent's pieces that represent pollution. However, in the spirit of 'Mute and continue,' players are occasionally met with 'soundless' challenges: moments when visual cues must be relied upon as the sound drifts away, adding layers of strategy. This peaceful silence encourages players to ponder their decisions, weaving in ethical considerations of ocean preservation throughout the gameplay. Echo Drift fosters an engaging experience with a soothing, contemplative atmosphere, making it accessible and meaningful to developers and players of all skill levels.",
