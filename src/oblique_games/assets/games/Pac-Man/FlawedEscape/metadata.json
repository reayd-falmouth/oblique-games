While retaining the core mechanics of navigating mazes and avoiding ghosts, this version introduces a unique challenge: Pac-Person, unlike the original, is prone to making occasional errors. These errors manifest as unexpected movements or delayed reactions, requiring players to adapt quickly and think strategically. The game explores the theme of imperfection, challenging players to succeed despite the unpredictability of human-like flaws. With updated graphics and sound, Pac-Person: Flawed Escape offers a nostalgic yet refreshing take on a beloved classic.",
