        "detailed_description": "Tilebound Territory takes the classic mechanics of Carcassonne and introduces a fresh perspective by altering the language and concepts within the game. Players take turns placing tiles to build a map, featuring cities, roads, and fields. However, the familiar terms have been reimagined to offer a new narrative experience. Cities become 'Hubs', roads are now 'Paths', and fields are referred to as 'Terrains'. The aim is to strategically place tiles and 'Pawns' (formerly known as Meeples) to control these areas and earn points. This reimagining of terminology encourages players to rethink their strategies and engage with the game world in a novel way, while still maintaining the core competitive and tactical essence of the original game.",
