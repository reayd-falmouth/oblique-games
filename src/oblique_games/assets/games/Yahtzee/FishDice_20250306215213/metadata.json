Players take on the role of sustainable fishers, rolling dice to match various fish species and fulfill quota cards, representing responsible fishing practices. Each roll has environmental consequences, teaching players about the importance of sustainability. Watch out for pollutants and overfishing, which add a strategic element to the game. The aim is not just to score points by rolling valuable combinations, but to do so while maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the fish population thrives.",
