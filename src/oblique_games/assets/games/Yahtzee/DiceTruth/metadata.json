In this game, players roll five dice and attempt to achieve various scoring combinations. However, the twist lies in the concept of 'truth'. After each roll, players are only shown partial information about their dice, requiring them to deduce the hidden results and make strategic choices based on incomplete data. The game challenges players to confront the reality of uncertainty and embrace risk-taking. It introduces new scoring categories that reward players for accurately predicting their hidden dice results, as well as for achieving traditional combinations. Dice Truth encourages players to think critically about the 'reality of the situation' and adapt their strategies accordingly, making for a compelling and thought-provoking gaming experience.\", 'tags': ['dice', 'strategy', 'board game', 'uncertainty', 'risk management', 'deduction', 'philosophical']}",
