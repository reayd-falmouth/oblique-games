        "detailed_description": "Tidefall Quest invites players to explore the deep sea in a classic action RPG style, combining the fast-paced combat and loot-driven mechanics of 'Diablo' with a unique focus on ocean life and sustainability. Set in a vibrant undersea kingdom where marine ecosystems are threatened by dark forces, players assume the role of a guardian tasked with saving the underwater realms. Through procedural dungeons filled with fish-like monsters and mythical sea creatures, players must balance their quest for power with ethical fishing and resource management. The game incorporates real-world principles of sustainability by rewarding players who engage in responsible practices and maintain the delicate balance of the undersea environment. While embracing well-known RPG tropes, Tidefall Quest offers a fresh take on the genre by integrating meaningful messages about conservation and the importance of ethical behavior in ecosystem preservation.",
