        "detailed_description": "In Reef Rescue, players act as stewards of a coral reef ecosystem. Inspired by the classic mechanics of 'Catan' but infused with a fish and sustainability theme, players collect resources such as algae, coral fragments, fish schools, and clean water to develop their sections of the reef. The game challenges players to balance growth and sustainability, making ethical decisions that affect the health of the reef in the long run. Oblique strategy ‘Short circuit’ is applied by introducing sudden resource shortages or surges due to environmental events, forcing players to quickly adapt their strategies. Success lies in fostering a self-sustaining reef ecosystem that thrives on biodiversity while maintaining balance with limited resources.",
