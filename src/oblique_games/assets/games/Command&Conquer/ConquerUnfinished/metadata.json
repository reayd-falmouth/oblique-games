        "detailed_description": "Conquer Unfinished challenges players to lead armies in a strategic real-time tactics environment reminiscent of classic 'Command & Conquer' games. However, the twist lies in its unique premise where the world is perpetually in a state of incompletion. Units, structures, and even the terrain are unfinished, requiring players to adapt their strategies to constantly changing conditions. Players must make do with partially built units, structures that evolve over time, and landscapes that shift, demanding innovative tactics and quick thinking. Victory is achieved not by completing tasks, but by mastering the art of adaptation and exploiting the unending flux of the unfinished world.",
