Players must guide their marble through a series of increasingly unpredictable levels filled with mind-bending obstacles and traps. Unlike traditional marble games, Marble Mayhem introduces elements that players would typically avoid, such as reverse gravity, invisible paths, and deceptive routes that challenge conventional gameplay strategies. Each level presents a unique puzzle, requiring players to think outside the box and embrace chaos to reach the finish line.",
