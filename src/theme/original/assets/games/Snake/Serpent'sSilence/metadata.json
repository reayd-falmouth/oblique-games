        "detailed_description": "Serpent's Silence is a reimagined version of the classic Snake game, where the traditional mechanics are infused with a unique twist inspired by the oblique strategy '[blank white card]'. In this version, the game focuses on creating a serene and meditative environment. The snake moves silently across a minimalist, zen-inspired landscape, where the usual obstacles and boundaries are replaced with soothing visuals and ambient sounds. The objective remains to grow the snake by consuming targets, but the emphasis is on achieving a state of calm and reflection rather than speed and competition. The game encourages players to find peace and focus as they guide the snake through an endless, tranquil journey.",
