        "detailed_description": "Silent Serpents transforms the traditional 'Snakes and Ladders' board game by introducing a unique challenge: players must navigate the board without verbal communication. Inspired by the oblique strategy 'Tape your mouth,' this version requires players to use gestures, facial expressions, or other non-verbal cues to interact with each other. The game maintains the familiar mechanics of climbing ladders and sliding down snakes, but adds a layer of strategy and creativity as players adapt to the communication constraint. This silent challenge encourages players to think outside the box and develop new ways to collaborate and compete.",
