In this game, players lead armies composed of mythical creatures and heroes across a richly detailed map. The twist is the innovative use of repetition as a strategic tool: actions and events can be echoed, allowing players to repeat certain moves or battles, creating dynamic changes in the gameplay. This mechanic encourages players to think creatively about how repetition can alter the course of their campaigns, offering a fresh take on tactical warfare.",
