        "detailed_description": "Frequency Finder is an innovative adaptation of the classic word game 'Boggle'. Players are challenged to find words in a grid of letters, but with a unique twist inspired by the oblique strategy 'Think of the radio'. In this version, the grid represents different radio frequencies, and players must tune into these frequencies to discover hidden words. As players connect letters to form words, they must consider the 'signal strength' of each letter, which varies and affects the score. The game introduces a dynamic layer of strategy, where players must balance finding long words with maintaining a strong signal. Additionally, special frequency tiles can be activated to boost scores or reveal hidden letters, adding depth and excitement to the gameplay.",
