These sanctuaries serve as anchors, allowing players to plan their explorations, manage resources, and upgrade their abilities.

Players must navigate treacherous terrain, solve puzzles, and defeat formidable bosses to unlock new abilities and areas. As they progress, the importance of finding and utilizing these safe zones becomes paramount, offering strategic depth and a unique twist on the classic formula.",
