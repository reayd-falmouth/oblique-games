In this game, players control cute dragon-like characters who must capture enemies in bubbles. However, the twist lies in the game's emphasis on words and phrases. Players must strategically change and use words to solve puzzles, unlock new areas, and communicate with friendly characters to progress through levels. The game's narrative explores the power of language, encouraging players to think about the impact of words as they navigate colorful and challenging environments.",
