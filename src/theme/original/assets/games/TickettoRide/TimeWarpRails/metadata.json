Players compete to build railway routes across a map that shifts through different historical periods. As time distorts, routes may change, and players must adapt their strategies to succeed. Collect cards, claim routes, and connect cities while navigating the challenges of time warp events that can alter the board and the rules. The game combines strategic planning with an unpredictable temporal element, offering a fresh experience with every playthrough.",
