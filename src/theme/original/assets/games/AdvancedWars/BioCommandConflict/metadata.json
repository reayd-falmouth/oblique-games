Set in a future where biotechnology has advanced to the point where machines are grown rather than built, players must command a variety of bio-engineered units on the battlefield. Each unit, from infantry to tanks, is a living organism enhanced with mechanical abilities. Players must adapt their strategies to the strengths and weaknesses of these organic machines, leveraging their unique abilities to outmaneuver and outsmart opponents. The game features a campaign mode with a rich narrative, multiplayer battles, and a map editor for endless replayability.",
