In this game, players not only engage in strategic moves typical of Checkers but also face unique engineering challenges that affect the board and pieces. Each turn, players must solve engineering puzzles or build structures to gain strategic advantages, such as altering the board layout or enhancing their pieces' abilities. This adds a layer of complexity and creativity to the classic game, making it a dynamic and intellectually stimulating experience.",
