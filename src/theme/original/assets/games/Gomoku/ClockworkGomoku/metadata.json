        "detailed_description": "Clockwork Gomoku is a fascinating twist on the traditional Gomoku game, infused with an innovative mechanical theme. In this version, the simple act of placing your stones takes on a new dimension as each move is tied to a clockwork mechanism. Players must navigate the board while managing the rhythmic challenges of the clockwork timer that affects how and when moves can be made. Mechanical elements create new strategic layers, challenging players to think several moves ahead and adapt their strategy based on the tempo of the clockwork. This variation on Gomoku offers both a nostalgic nod to the original game and a fresh, idiosyncratic challenge that will test the strategic prowess of any player.",
