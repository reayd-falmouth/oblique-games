Set in a cityscape filled with chaos, players take on the role of a street fighter battling through waves of enemies. The unique twist in Bridge Brawler lies in its strategic use of 'Bridges - build - burn'. Players must construct bridges to traverse gaps and reach new areas, while also deciding when to burn these bridges to prevent enemies from following or to access hidden paths. The game features fast-paced combat, diverse enemy types, and challenging bosses, combined with strategic bridge management that adds a layer of tactical depth. Players can upgrade their bridge-building abilities and fighting skills as they progress, offering a blend of action and strategy.",
