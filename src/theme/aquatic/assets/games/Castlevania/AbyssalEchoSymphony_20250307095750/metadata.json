By feeding these recorded echoes back into the environment, players can influence and reshape their surroundings dynamically. The game emphasizes themes of sustainability and ethics, tasking players with cleaning up pollution, repairing coral reefs, and negotiating with sea life for peaceful coexistence. These actions promote awareness of marine conservation while providing an engaging and unique gameplay experience.",
