Incorporating ecosystem sustainability, the game invites players to make ethical choices while focusing on a central mystery: 'Do we need holes?'.",
        "detailed_description": "In Abyss Ascent, players embark on an underwater adventure where the goal is to ascend through multiple aquatic levels, each teeming with unique sea life like jellyfish, cephalopods, and more. As they explore the depths of the ocean, players encounter various obstacles and platforms, which may include natural formations, shipwrecks, and modern submarines. Each level offers new challenges and mechanics that require strategic thinking and adaptability. A key feature is the recurring question, 'Do we need holes?', which introduces a puzzle element where players decide whether opening or closing gaps (holes) in the environment influences their path or affects the marine ecosystem. The game encourages players to think about sustainability and ethics, presenting choices that impact the ocean environment positively or negatively. Incorporating stunning visuals and a soothing aquatic soundtrack, Abyss Ascent offers both relaxing and thought-provoking gameplay in a thematic, immersive experience.",
