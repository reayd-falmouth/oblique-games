The tiles are beautifully illustrated with marine creatures, coral formations, and sustainable fishing practices. The game encourages players to 'Go slowly all the way round the outside', engaging them to thoughtfully remove tile pairs while contemplating the ethics around each marine subject depicted. With each match, players learn about the importance of preserving marine biodiversity and the impact of sustainable practices in fisheries and ocean conservation.",
