Set in a lush underwater environment, the game focuses on creating \"riffs\" of cards symbolizing different marine species. These riffs represent the harmony and balance needed to maintain oceanic ecosystems. Players collect and meld sets of cards depicting various fish and underwater flora, with each turn representing a \"single beat\" or decision point that affects the larger ecosystem. Strategic thinking is required to sustain and ethically manage the collection of marine resources in this captivating card game, encouraging players to reflect on the impact of their actions in a fragile environment.",
