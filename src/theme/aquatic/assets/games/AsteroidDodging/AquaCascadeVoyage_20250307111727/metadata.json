The aim is to navigate through these dynamic challenges, represented by debris, rocks, and ocean fauna, ethically collecting resources and avoiding harm to the marine ecosystem. Inspired by concepts of sustainable interaction with nature, players must make thoughtful decisions to balance their progress with the impact on the aquatic environment. Fun and engaging for developers and players of all skill levels, it emphasizes ethical gameplay by rewarding choices that promote ocean health and sustainable practices.",
