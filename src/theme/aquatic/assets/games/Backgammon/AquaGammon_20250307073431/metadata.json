Players move their pieces, depicted as sea creatures, across a board styled like a coral reef. The game introduces the inconsistency principle, with shifting currents that alter the game board unpredictably. These environmental changes force players to adapt their strategies mid-game, simulating the dynamic nature of ocean ecosystems. The game encourages players to consider ethical and sustainable practices by integrating elements such as plastic waste prevention and marine conservation. AquaGammon is designed to be engaging for all skill levels, offering a blend of traditional gameplay with modern environmental themes.",
