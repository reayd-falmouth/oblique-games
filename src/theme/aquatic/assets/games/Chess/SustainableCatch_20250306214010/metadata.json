The game promotes sustainability by requiring players to maintain the balance of the ocean while achieving victory. Every move is a decision with consequences, emphasizing the importance of ethical choices in fishing and marine conservation. Boring moves contain deep educational messages about sustainability, inviting players to rethink traditional strategies in favor of ecological balance. This thought-provoking, strategic game encourages players to ponder their impacts on the oceans, all within the familiar yet innovative framework of Chess.",
