In this turn-based city building game, players must carefully plan and develop their city by constructing buildings, managing resources, and maintaining ecological balance. Inspired by the mysterious and silent depths of the ocean, players are encouraged to 'listen' to the environment and adapt their strategies accordingly, ensuring the sustainability of their aquatic world. With a focus on ethical decision-making, players will navigate challenges that arise from overfishing, pollution, and resource scarcity, all while working to create a harmonious and thriving underwater habitat.",
