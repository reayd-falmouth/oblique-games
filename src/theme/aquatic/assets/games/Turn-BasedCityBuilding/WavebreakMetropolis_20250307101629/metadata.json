The objective is to build a sustainable and thriving metropolis beneath the waves, with a twist: the traditional lifeline of freshwater from rivers has been severed, forcing players to innovate new methods of water management and resource distribution. Players must manage their city's resources carefully, leveraging ocean currents, desalination technologies, and sustainable energy solutions. Ethical decisions play a crucial role as players encounter dilemmas such as balancing environmental conservation with urban expansion and ensuring equitable resource distribution among citizens. This creative spin on city-building encourages developers at all skill levels to explore a fresh, engaging challenge while considering the impacts of their decisions on the ecosystem.",
