In this side-to-side shooter, players control marine conservationists piloting eco-friendly submarines. The unique twist is that players must highlight and amplify the most embarrassing details of pollution and environmental neglect, such as massive floating garbage islands and surreal plastic wildlife hybrids. The game encourages players to shoot these embarrassing elements with ethically-sourced cleaning technology and engage in mini-games that educate about sustainability. With a focus on ethics, players must make strategic choices about resource usage and cooperation with local communities to restore the aquatic ecosystems. The vibrant graphics and fun gameplay mechanics make it suitable for developers of all skill levels, while also imparting an important message about ocean conservation and sustainable practices.",
