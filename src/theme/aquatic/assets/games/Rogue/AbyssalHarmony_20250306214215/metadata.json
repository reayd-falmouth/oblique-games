Using simplistic controls, the game focuses on the essence of ocean biodiversity and the interconnectedness of species. The player takes on the role of a guardian fish navigating procedurally generated underwater labyrinths. The core mechanics rely on a single action button, embodying the oblique strategy of simplifying gameplay to its lowest common denominator. This reflects the delicate balance of marine ecosystems. Key challenges include managing resources wisely, protecting the environment from pollution, and forging connections with sea creatures to maintain the harmony of the deep. The game's minimalist style reflects the single beat, riff, and note analogy, creating a resonant experience of ecological preservation in a vibrant aquatic world.",
