        "detailed_description": "Ocean Balance challenges players to rethink their approach to marine ecosystem management by discarding traditional assumptions about humans' role in the environment. Instead of being outside observers or exploiters, players are embedded within the system, experiencing the ocean's intricacies firsthand. The game involves managing a small coastal region, where you must balance fishing activities, pollution control, and marine species protection. Decisions are made from the perspective of different species, promoting empathy and understanding of their impact on the environment. Players must navigate ethical dilemmas, choosing between short-term gain and long-term ecosystem health. Innovative mechanics encourage learning about biodiversity, conservation tactics, and sustainable practices, challenging players to maintain the equilibrium of the ocean world by embracing an interconnected mindset.",
