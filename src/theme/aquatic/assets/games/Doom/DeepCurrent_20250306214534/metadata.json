As a deep-sea diver armed with specialized harpoons and eco-friendly gadgets, players navigate through submerged environments filled with mysterious marine life and ancient ruins. The goal is to protect the fragile aquatic ecosystems from invasive species threatening the balance. Strategic resource management is key, as players must carefully choose which elements to preserve and which to let go. The game's minimalist design supports the theme, removing unnecessary elements to focus on conservation and the impact of actions on the environment. Deep Current offers a compelling mix of action and thoughtful engagement with sustainability challenges.",
