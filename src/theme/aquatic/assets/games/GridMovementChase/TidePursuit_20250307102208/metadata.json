        "detailed_description": "In Tide Pursuit, players controls a team of marine creatures such as a dolphin, sea turtle, and jellyfish, navigating a complex grid system. The objective is to collect sustainable resources and avoid capture by fishermen who threaten the marine ecosystem. Players must strategically move their creatures across rivers, seas, and parts of the ocean, each with unique challenges. With an emphasis on ecological sustainability, the game challenges players to practice ethical decisions by balancing resource collection with conservation. Strategic thinking is encouraged by outsmarting human threats, similar to how a friend might encourage creative solutions in challenging situations. The aquatic theme is strengthened with vibrant ocean graphics, dynamic music, and educational elements about marine life and the importance of sustainability.",
