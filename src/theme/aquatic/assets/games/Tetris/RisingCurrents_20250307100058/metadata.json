Players must manipulate various tetromino pieces, each representing a different aspect of marine life or oceanic elements, to clear lines and restore balance to an increasingly polluted sea. The quiet voice of the ocean guides players in subtle shifts, encouraging ethical decisions that impact the game's ecosystems. Special blocks appear as trash that must be cleared to save marine life, while sustainable power-ups provide environmental benefits. The game emphasizes listening to the oceanâ€™s needs, portraying the delicate balance necessary for a thriving aquatic world. Engaging for developers of all skill levels, Rising Currents combines engaging gameplay with a strong message about ocean conservation and the impact of human actions on our fragile waters.",
