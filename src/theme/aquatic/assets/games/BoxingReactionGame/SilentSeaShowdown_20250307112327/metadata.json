        "detailed_description": "Silent Sea Showdown plunges you into the depths of an enchanting ocean world where battles are fought not with words, but with precise actions and quick reflexes. Inspired by game jam themes, the game revolves around the concept of an underwater boxing ring featuring sea creatures like jellyfish, cephalopods, and submarines as both settings and participants. The silent 'boxing' matches require players to react quickly to visual cues, engaging in rhythmic dodges and attacks. As you navigate this aquatic arena, you must also consider the impact of your actions on the ocean's ecology, promoting ethical interactions and sustainability. By harnessing the oblique strategy 'Tape your mouth' from Ritva Saarikko, the game creatively forbids verbal communication, encouraging players to rely on the rich sounds and visuals of the underwater world to guide their actions, making it accessible to developers and players of all skill levels.",
