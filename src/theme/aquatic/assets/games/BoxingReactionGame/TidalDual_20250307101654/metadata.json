        "detailed_description": "Tidal Dual is a creative blend of a boxing reaction game with an aquatic theme, designed for a game jam. Players take on the role of various aquatic creatures, each representing different ocean ecosystems, in underwater boxing arenas. The gameplay revolves around quick reaction times and strategic moves, as players aim to knock out opponents and gain control over critical ocean regions. The game utilizes the oblique strategy of 'A line has two sides' by presenting two opposing forces: the health of ocean ecosystems and the aggressive tendencies of the creatures. This juxtaposition supports awareness of ethics and sustainability, urging players to balance aggressive gameplay with the consequences of overfishing and habitat destruction. The game is simple yet captivating, suitable for developers of any skill level, encouraging thoughtful reflection on the impact of human actions on marine environments.",
