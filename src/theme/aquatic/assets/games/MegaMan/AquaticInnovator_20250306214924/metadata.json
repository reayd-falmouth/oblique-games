Drawing inspiration from classic Mega Man games, players must jump, shoot, and dash through various levels filled with robotic sea creatures, obstacles, and puzzles. The game uniquely incorporates a fish theme, emphasizing ethical interactions with aquatic life and sustainable practices. Players must decide how to tackle challenges that involve preserving marine ecosystems while combating pollution and invasive species. With the oblique strategy 'Repetition is a form of change,' the game features reusable mechanics, such as repeated engagement with environmental elements that evolve with each interaction, leading to different outcomes. Progressing through the game involves not only defeating enemies but also choosing how repetitive actions can lead to positive changes in the underwater world.",
