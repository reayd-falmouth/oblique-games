        "detailed_description": "Oceanic Convergence invites players into a vibrant underwater world filled with aquatic beauty and ecological challenges. Players solve tile-matching puzzles that mimic the diverse ecosystems within the ocean. Each level introduces new elements, such as coral reefs, marine life, and ocean currents. The core mechanic combines traditional matching with logic puzzles, compelling players to make strategic decisions that affect the health of the virtual marine environment. Inspired by the oblique strategy 'Faced with a choice, do both,' the game allows players to balance two goals: clearing the board and maintaining the ecosystem's balance. Ethics and sustainability are woven into the gameplay, as players encounter mini-tasks that educate them on the role of pollution, overfishing, and conservation efforts. Suitable for game developers of all skill levels, Oceanic Convergence aims to engage players with both its challenging puzzles and impactful message.",
