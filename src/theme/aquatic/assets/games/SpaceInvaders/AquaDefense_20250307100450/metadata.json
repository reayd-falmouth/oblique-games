Players are tasked with defending the ocean and its inhabitants from an alien threat. Using sustainable tactics, such as deploying biodegradable nets and eco-friendly decoys, players must prevent the invaders from polluting the seas and harming marine life. The game's design encourages creative thinking by introducing 'short circuit' mini-games that players must solve to disable alien ships non-lethally. This approach emphasizes ethical gameplay and educates players on the importance of ocean conservation and the impact of pollution on aquatic ecosystems. Suitable for all skill levels, Aqua Defense combines action, strategy, and educational elements to create a truly unique and thought-provoking experience.",
