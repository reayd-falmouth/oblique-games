        "detailed_description": "Abyssal Conquest invites players into the depths of the ocean to engage in strategic underwater warfare on a hex-based map. Players command unique aquatic units like sea-serpent cavalry, coral fortress defenders, and schools of tactical fish to claim and control critical underwater hexes. Incorporating nature's nuances, each hex might have special ecosystems that players must protect to maintain balance and earn sustainability points. With an emphasis on ethical engagement, strategies must consider the health of the aquatic environment, rewarding players who prevent pollution and over-exploitation. The unique 'breathe more deeply' mechanic allows players to pause and regenerate their resources sustainably by appreciating the surrounding biodiversity and ecosystems, introducing an innovative twist to traditional turn-based strategy gameplay. Perfect for game developers of all levels, Abyssal Conquest offers both creative engagement and a meaningful discourse on oceanic conservation, encapsulating an impactful game jam experience.",
