Set against the backdrop of a mysterious, upside-down aquatic universe, players must solve puzzles and make decisions that not only affect their journey but also the delicate balance of this surreal marine ecosystem. As they traverse through inverted seas and rivers, players encounter unique sea creatures, each adapting to the reversed environment, reflecting on themes of ethics and sustainability along the way. The game challenges players to think critically about their impact on the ecosystem, prompting them to reconsider conventional ethics and explore new forms of sustainable coexistence within the game's aquatic realms.",
