Players assemble a crew of marine creatures, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, to explore the perilous abyss.

Guided by the oblique strategy 'What wouldn't you do?', players must consider unconventional tactics and embrace morally complex choices to survive. Navigate through haunting underwater caverns, encountering morally ambiguous situations where you must balance the health of your crew against the well-being of the ocean. The game emphasizes the importance of responsible actions and sustainability in a world where every choice affects the fragile ecosystem of the deep sea.",
