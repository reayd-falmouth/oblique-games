Players explore the depths of an underwater world, taking on the role of a guardian spirit tasked with confronting the damage done to the oceans. The game integrates ethics and sustainability into its core mechanics, challenging players to make difficult decisions about resource management and ecological impact. Throughout the journey, children's voices—voicing, speaking, and singing—intertwine with the environment, acting as the conscience and emotional guide for the player. These voices provide insights, warnings, and encouragement as players fight against pollution and overfishing while trying to restore harmony to the marine ecosystem.",
