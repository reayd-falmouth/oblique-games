The player's units, inspired by various marine creatures, must navigate reefs, kelp forests, and shipwrecks to outmaneuver rival factions. Each tactical decision addresses the balance of utilizing resources sustainably versus the immediate benefits of overconsumption. In a twist inspired by the oblique strategy 'The tape is now the music,' the natural rhythms and sounds of the ocean itself become a key gameplay mechanic, dictating the flow of actions and affecting strategies. Players must listen and adapt to these wave-like patterns to master the tide of battle, reflecting the harmony and dissonance of nature itself.",
