The Heart cards floating around them in a semi-circle, with each card depicting a different yoga posture.\n\nThe top right corner, symbolizing Diamonds, showcases a healthy eating scene.

Implement a classic pixel art style, with a touch of modern elements for a sleek design. The pixel characters should be detailed and expressive. \n\nEssential Cover Requirements for itch.io:\n\nEnsure the image is at a minimum of 315x250, but for better quality, aim for the recommended 630x500. Make sure all important elements and the game title are clearly visible even at the smallest size.
