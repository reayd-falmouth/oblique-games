There should be two protagonists, representing 'Brain' and 'Brawn', standing in the middle of the scene. \n\n'Brain' is a frail looking character with glasses, holding a book titled 'Riddles' in one hand and a magnifying glass in the other. His eyes should sparkle with intelligence and curiosity. 'Brawn' is a muscular character holding a dumbbell in one hand and a fresh apple in the other, symbolizing physical strength and healthy eating. His strong posture should reflect his physical fitness.\n\nThe background should show different aspects of a healthy lifestyle. On one side, there should be a hill with people jogging, someone meditating under a tree, and a farmer's market filled with fruits and vegetables. On the other side, there should be a large library, a complex maze (representing the riddles), and a group of people playing chess.\n\nFollowing the oblique strategy of 'Faced with a choice, do both', the game cover should show that Brain & Brawn are not mutually exclusive but work together in this quest. The two characters should be standing back to back, showing their unity and shared purpose.\n\nStyle Suggestions:\n\nUse bright and energetic colors to represent the vibrancy of a healthy lifestyle. The color palette should be dominated by greens, blues, and yellows, with some warm earth tones for balance. The pixel art style should be detailed but charming, with a touch of nostalgia. \n\nThe title of the game should be in bold, pixelated letters at the top of the image. It should be in a contrasting color to stand out against the background. The font should be fun and inviting, reflecting the adventurous and playful spirit of the game."
