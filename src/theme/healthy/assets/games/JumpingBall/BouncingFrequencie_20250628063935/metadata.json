The ball is designed to look like it's bouncing in a continuous upward motion, leaving a trail of pixelated musical notes and sound waves behind it as it moves, symbolizing 'frequencies'. \n\nAround the ball, illustrate a pixelated environment that represents a variety of healthy habits. On one corner, show a pixelated apple tree, with a few apples fallen to the ground, symbolizing the habit of eating healthy. On the opposite corner, depict a pixelated bicycle leaning against a wall, symbolizing physical activity. \n\nIn the background, create a pixelated skyline with an array of colorful buildings in the far distance. Above the skyline, fill the sky with a gradient of warm, inviting colors like pink, orange and yellow, indicating a sunrise or sunset, which could hint at the importance of regular sleep.\n\nTo incorporate the 'Think of the radio' oblique strategy, include a large, vintage pixelated radio tower in the background image, perhaps on a hill or a tall building. The radio tower is emitting pixelated sound waves that are in sync with the bouncing ball, creating a visual connection between the tower and the ball.\n\nThe game's title \"Bouncing Frequencies\" is in bold, pixelated letters at the top of the cover image. The font is retro, perhaps inspired by 80s arcade games, and is colored in a gradient matching the sky's color scheme.\n\nThe bottom of the cover includes a small pixelated display of the recommended and minimum pixel dimensions for itch.io, reminding the viewer of the platform's requirements."
