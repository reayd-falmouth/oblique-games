        "image_prompt": "Image Prompt:\n\nFor the 'Tamagotchi Wellne' game, envision a nostalgic, yet modern pixel art cover image that instantly conveys the theme of 'Virtual Pet Care' and 'Healthy Habits'. The cover image should be 1024x1024 pixels in resolution to ensure high quality, but also make sure it meets the minimum cover requirements for itch.io (315x250 pixels, recommended 630x500 pixels).\n\nThe main focus of the image should be a vibrant, pixelated Tamagotchi device in the center. The Tamagotchi screen displays a cute, smiling pixelated creature, radiating health and happiness. It's exercising with a tiny dumbbell in one hand (to represent 'Healthy Habits') and eating an apple in the other.\n\nThe Tamagotchi device is styled in a retro design (to represent the 'Use an old idea' strategy). It's a nod to the original Tamagotchis of the 90s, with a rectangular shape and three simple buttons beneath the screen.\n\nThe background is styled as a pixelated living room scene, with a comfortable couch, a shelf with books, and a window revealing a sunny day outside. This setting suggests a homey, casual gaming atmosphere.\n\nIn the lower third of the image, place the game title 'Tamagotchi Wellne'. Use a pixel font for the game title to match the overall style, with colors that contrast well against the background for readability. Consider a brighter color, like white or bright yellow, for the title to make it stand out.\n\nStyle Suggestions:\n\n1. Use a limited color palette to maintain the retro, nostalgic feel. Bright, bold colors can be used to highlight important elements like the Tamagotchi device and game title. \n2. Keep the pixel art simple and charming. It doesn't need to be overly complex or detailed. The emphasis should be on the Tamagotchi and its healthy habits.\n3. The overall style should be cheerful and inviting, encouraging players to engage with the game and take care of their virtual pet.\n4. Textures can be used subtly to give depth to the image without distracting from the main elements. \n\nRemember to keep the image clear and readable at smaller sizes to meet itch.io's cover requirements."
