        "image_prompt": "Title: Serene Rhythm\n\nImage Size: 1024x1024 pixels\n\nPlatform Requirements: The image should also be optimized for a minimum size of 315x250 pixels and a recommended size of 630x500 pixels for itch.io.\n\nImage Prompt Details:\n\nThe cover image will be a vibrant and engaging portrayal of the game's theme - Healthy Habits. The image must be filled with pixelated art that can express tranquility, rhythm, and the essence of maintaining good habits.\n\nForeground: \nIn the center, depict a stylized, pixel art character engrossed in meditation. Their legs should be crossed, and their eyes closed, with headphones on their ears, tapping their fingers in rhythm to unseen music. This character is our representation of the player engaged in the tap timing challenge of the game.\n\nBackground:\nThe background should be a serene landscape - a calming garden full of pixelated trees, flowers, and a sparkling stream flowing from one side to the other. The scene should depict early morning, with the rising sun casting a golden hue over the garden. \n\nMiddle Ground:\nIn the middle ground, illustrate various symbols representing healthy habits. Show a pixel art apple, a water bottle, a yoga mat, a pair of running shoes, and a bicycle. These items should be slightly blurred to create depth, not detracting from the main character but still noticeable.\n\nBorders:\nThe image should have a thin border with a soft, glowing effect, not too bright, but enough to make the image pop. \n\nTypography: \nPlace the game's title, 'Serene Rhythm', at the top-center of the cover in bold, pixelated letters. The font color should contrast with the background but maintain the serene feeling. Consider soft blue or a cool green.\n\nStyle Suggestions:\nThe pixel art should use a pastel color palette to evoke a sense of calm and serenity. The pixels should be fairly detailed, especially within the central character, to create a sense of depth and dimension. Use gradients and shading to add a sense of realism to the pixelated world, making it more immersive and appealing.\n\nRemember, the essence of the game is to not break the silence, which should be reflected in the calm and tranquil elements of the cover art."
