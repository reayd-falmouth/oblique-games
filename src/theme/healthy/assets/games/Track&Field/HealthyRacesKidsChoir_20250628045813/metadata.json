        "image_prompt": "Title: Healthy Races Kids Choir\n\nCover Image Size: 1024x1024 pixels\n\nStyle: Retro 8-bit pixel art for a nostalgic yet kid-friendly feel. Use bright, bold colors to draw attention and make the cover engaging for children.\n\nImage Description:\n\nIn the foreground, depict a diverse group of pixelated children in choir robes with their mouths open, singing into retro-style microphones. They should look joyful and energetic, their hands raised in the air as if they are in the middle of an enthusiastic performance. Use a variety of skin tones and hair colors to show diversity.\n\nBehind them, show a pixelated 'Track & Field' scene. Kids of different shapes and sizes should be participating in various activities like running, jumping, and throwing. Some should be drinking water, eating fruits, or stretching, emphasizing the 'Healthy Habits' theme. \n\nInclude a pixelated sun in the sky, radiating lines of light to symbolize vitality and health. The sun could be anthropomorphized, wearing sunglasses, and has a broad smile to make it more appealing to kids. \n\nAt the bottom of the scene, include the game title \"Healthy Races Kids Choir\" in bold, pixelated letters. The title should be easy to read and stand out against the background.\n\nStyle Suggestions:\n\nUse a color palette of bright greens, blues, and yellows to create a cheerful, energetic mood. Use darker shades for shadows and depth. The title should be in a contrasting color, perhaps a bold red or orange, to make it pop.\n\nEssential Cover Requirements for itch.io:\n\nEnsure that when scaled down to the minimum dimensions of 315x250 pixels (recommended 630x500 pixels), the title and main elements of the cover (choir kids and track & field activities) are still clearly visible and identifiable. The cover should still look attractive and readable even at smaller sizes."
