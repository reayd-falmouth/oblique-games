        "image_prompt": "Title: Wellness Jolt Jam\n\nImage Details:\nThe cover image should be a 1024x1024 pixel art designed to fit the itch.io cover requirements of minimum 315x250 pixels, and ideally 630x500 pixels. \n\nDesign:\nThe main theme of the game is 'Healthy Habits' within a 'Merge Puzzle' game setup. The cover should showcase this theme vividly. \n\nForeground:\nIn the foreground, illustrate a character in mid-action of merging two items symbolizing healthy habits. One hand could be holding a vibrant, pixelated apple (symbolizing nutritious eating), and the other hand could be holding a pixelated dumbbell (symbolizing exercise). As they merge in the middle, there should be a bright jolt of energy, playing into the title 'Wellness Jolt Jam'.\n\nBackground:\nThe background should be a stylized representation of a healthy environment. Consider a pixelated outdoor scene with trees, a sunny sky with fluffy pixel clouds, and a park with people jogging or doing yoga. \n\nStyle Suggestions: \n1. Use bright, energetic colors to bring out the energetic and positive theme of the game. \n2. The style should be retro pixel art, giving a nod to classic arcade games. \n3. The elements should be clear and easily distinguishable even when scaled down.\n\nShort Circuit Oblique Strategy:\nThis strategy suggests an unexpected or abrupt change in the process. In this context, you could introduce a short circuit in the merging process of the two healthy habit items. Instead of the expected perfect merge, there could be pixel sparks flying out, or the character could have a surprised expression. This adds an element of unpredictability and excitement to the game cover.\n\nText:\nPosition the game title 'Wellness Jolt Jam' at the top of the cover in bold, pixelated font. At the bottom, include the tagline: 'Merge your way to Healthy Habits!' in a slightly smaller pixelated font. \n\nThe cover should be vibrant, engaging, and accurately represent the fun, healthy theme of the game."
