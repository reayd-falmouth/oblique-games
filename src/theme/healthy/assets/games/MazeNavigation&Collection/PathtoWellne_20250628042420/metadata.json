Use bright colors to emphasize key elements and darker shades for the background or less important elements.\n\nComposition:\n- Background: Depict a complex yet engaging maze, representing the path to wellness. The maze should be filled with lush greens and blues to invoke a sense of tranquility and serenity. Make the maze walls look like vines or green hedges.\n- Foreground: Place the main character at the entrance of the maze. The character should be a pixelated human figure, perhaps holding a map or compass, ready to navigate the maze. \n- Collection Items: Randomly spread throughout the maze, show pixel art representations of various healthy habits â€“ a fruit for healthy eating, a water bottle for hydration, a running shoe for exercise, a book for mental wellness, etc. These items should be in vibrant colors to stand out against the maze.\n- Oblique Strategy - 'Accept Advice': Show the character receiving advice from a wise old tree or a talking animal at the beginning of the maze. The advice could be represented in a speech bubble with a pixelated text like \"Balance is the key!\"\n\nTypography:\n- Game Title: Place 'Path to Wellne' at the top or bottom of the cover. The title should be in bold, friendly, and easy-to-read pixelated font. Make sure to use colors that contrast with the background for clarity.\n- Prominent Features: If there is any tagline or significant game feature, it should also be included underneath the title or at a suitable empty space, ensuring it doesn't clutter the overall design.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make the cover art engaging and representative of the game's core theme: Navigating through the maze of wellness by adopting healthy habits."
