Use bright and lively colors to signify health and wellness. The overall color palette should lean towards green and blue shades, symbolizing tranquility and positivity. \n\nDetailed Image Description: \n\nThe central image should be a stylized, pixelated hand popping bubble wrap. The bubbles that are being popped should transform into pixelated icons representing healthy habits like an apple, a water bottle, a dumbbell, or a bicycle. \n\nIn the upper part of the cover, place the game's title 'Pop Wellne' in bold, pixelated letters, with each letter a different color from your bright palette. Above the title, place a smaller subtitle that reads 'Pop your way to wellness!'\n\nIn the lower part of the cover, depict a pixelated scene of a healthy lifestyle - a park with trees, a person doing yoga, or someone riding a bicycle. \n\nIn the background, use the oblique strategy of a blank white card to create a simple, clean, and minimalist backdrop, allowing the vibrant pixel art to stand out. \n\nEnsure that the cover remains clear and legible even when scaled down to itch.io's essential cover requirements (minimum 315x250, recommended 630x500). \n\nRemember, the aim is to create a pixel art game cover that is not only eye-catching but also communicates the game's key themes of health, wellness, and fun."
