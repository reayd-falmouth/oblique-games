        "image_prompt": "Title: Labyrinth Blueprint\n\nTheme: Maze Navigation & Collection\n\nOblique Strategy: Discover the recipes you are using and abandon them\n\nImage Size: 1024x1024 pixels \n\nEssential Cover Requirements: Minimum 315x250 pixels, recommended 630x500 pixels for itch.io.\n\nImage Prompt:\n\nVisualize a top-down blueprint of a complex labyrinth. The labyrinth should be intricate and sprawling, with numerous twists and turns. Use a subdued color palette of blues, grays, and whites to give the impression of a traditional architectural blueprint.\n\nThe labyrinth is unfilled, signifying a 'plan'. Various maze navigation tools such as a compass, a map, and a pencil should be strategically placed around the blueprint, rendered in pixel art in a slightly brighter color to stand out against the blueprint's background. \n\nIn some corners of the labyrinth, scatter pixel-art representations of the items to be collected - keys, coins, treasure chests, etc. These should be in a golden color to stand out well against the blueprint. \n\nIn the center of the labyrinth, place a pixel-art representation of a grand prize - a glowing golden trophy or a majestic crown. \n\nIn one of the corners, you can place a pair of pixel-art glasses to signify the strategy of abandoning the usual path and looking at the maze with a fresh perspective.\n\nOn the top part of the cover, leave space for the game title 'Labyrinth Blueprint'. The title should be stylized in pixel art, using bold letters in a vibrant color, like red or orange, to stand out against the blueprint. \n\nStyle Suggestions:\n\nThe pixel art style should be detailed and intricate, with a strong emphasis on shadows and highlights to create a 3D effect. Use dithering to create gradients and textures. The overall style should evoke a sense of adventure and strategy, aligning with the game's theme. \n\nEnsure the layout and colors adhere to itch.io's cover requirements - it should be clear and impactful even at a smaller resolution of 315x250 pixels, while ideally looking its best at 630x500 pixels."
