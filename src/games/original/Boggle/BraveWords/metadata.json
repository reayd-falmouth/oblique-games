        "detailed_description": "BraveWords reinvents the traditional Boggle game by incorporating the concept of 'Courage!' as an oblique strategy. In this game, players shake a grid of lettered dice and attempt to find as many words as possible within a time limit. However, BraveWords challenges players to make daring word choices, offering bonus points for using rare letters or forming longer words. The game encourages players to think outside the box and embrace boldness in their word selection. Special 'courage tiles' on the board provide additional incentives for players to take risks, adding an exciting layer of strategy and thrill to the gameplay.",
