The realm is bound by an ancient curse that limits sound and communication. Players must solve puzzles, interact with enigmatic characters, and unravel the story using minimal dialogue and clues. The game emphasizes environmental storytelling and visual cues, challenging players to use their intuition and perception to progress. Immerse yourself in a world where silence is powerful, and every sound holds the key to your journey.",
