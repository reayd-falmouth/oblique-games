Inspired by the oblique strategy 'Allow an easement,' the game introduces a flexible gameplay mechanic that lets players abandon certain rules and restrictions, leading to unexpected and dynamic gameplay experiences. This easement mechanic allows players to manipulate dungeon elements, such as altering enemy behaviors, reshaping pathways, or changing item effects, encouraging creative problem-solving and exploration. The game's atmosphere is both challenging and liberating, as players must decide when and how to apply these easements to overcome obstacles and progress through the ever-changing labyrinth.",
