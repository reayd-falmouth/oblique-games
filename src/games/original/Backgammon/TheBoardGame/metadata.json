        "detailed_description": "Monotony: The Board Game takes the traditional game of Backgammon and adds an unexpected twist by embracing the concept of monotony. This version retains the classic elements of Backgammon, such as moving pieces around the board based on dice rolls and aiming to bear off all your checkers. However, the game introduces 'boring' elements to enhance the monotony, such as repetitive dice rolls, uniform board design, and a simplified strategy approach. The game's objective remains the same, but the pacing and aesthetics are intentionally designed to evoke a sense of routine and predictability, challenging players to find excitement in the mundane.",
