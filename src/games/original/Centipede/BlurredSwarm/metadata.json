The centipede is no longer a defined creature but a shifting, flowing entity that changes form and behavior. Players must adapt to its unpredictable movements and appearances, relying on intuition and quick reflexes. The environment is a kaleidoscope of abstract shapes and colors, creating an immersive atmosphere that challenges perception and strategy. Every playthrough is unique, offering endless possibilities and keeping players on their toes as they attempt to decipher and conquer the enigmatic swarm.",
