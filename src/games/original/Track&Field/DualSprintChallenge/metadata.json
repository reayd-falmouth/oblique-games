        "detailed_description": "Dual Sprint Challenge reimagines the traditional track and field racing game by introducing a dual-track system where players compete simultaneously on two parallel tracks. Each track presents its own set of obstacles and challenges, requiring players to strategize and switch focus between the tracks effectively. The game emphasizes quick decision-making and adaptability as players must navigate hurdles, water pits, and varying terrain on both sides. With its innovative approach inspired by the oblique strategy 'A line has two sides', Dual Sprint Challenge offers a fresh and dynamic racing experience that tests both physical agility and mental acuity.",
