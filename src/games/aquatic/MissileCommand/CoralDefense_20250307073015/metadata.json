Taking inspiration from classic missile command-style gameplay, players control a line of sustainable defenses on the ocean floor. Enemies come in the form of pollutants and destructive forces traveling with the currents, which players must intercept before they reach and damage the precious reef ecosystem. Each successful defense bolsters the reef's health, and players can upgrade their abilities using resources generated from healthy marine life. The game introduces an ethical layer by encouraging players to protect marine environments, highlighting the importance of maintaining biodiversity and the impact of pollution. Applying the \"Look at a very small object; look at its center\" strategy, the game zooms in on individual coral polyps as a means to view the broader ecosystem's health, asking players to focus on micro-level interactions to strategize effectively.',\n  'tags': ['aquatic', 'strategy', 'missile command', 'sustainability', 'ethical', 'ocean', 'environmental awareness', 'marine life', 'underwater', 'game jam']\n}",
