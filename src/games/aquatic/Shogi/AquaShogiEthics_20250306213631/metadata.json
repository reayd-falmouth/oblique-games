Players engage in tactical battles using pieces represented by various fish species, each with unique abilities and movement patterns. The game integrates a compelling theme of ethics and sustainability, where players must balance their strategies with ecological preservation. Actions may lead to ethical dilemmas - capture too many fish, and the underwater ecosystem suffers, affecting gameplay. Players are challenged to remember previous mistakes to avoid similar ethical pitfalls, encouraging reflection on past actions for sustainable success.",
