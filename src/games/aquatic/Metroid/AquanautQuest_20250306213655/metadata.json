The game adopts a metroidvania style, challenging players to navigate a labyrinthine series of underwater caverns and coral reefs, utilizing new abilities and equipment to access previously unreachable areas. The narrative centers on themes of ocean ethics and sustainability, as players uncover secrets about the underwater ecosystem and strive to restore balance to damaged environments. An important game mechanic involves working with unqualified or amateur allies, who provide unique but unconventional solutions to problems, underlining the game's message that everyone can contribute to environmental stewardship in their own way.",
