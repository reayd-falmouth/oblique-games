        "detailed_description": "In Tideweaver Quest, players embark on a journey through a vibrant aquatic world, solving tile-matching and logic puzzles. The game is set against a backdrop of diverse aquatic environments, featuring oceans, seas, and rivers. Using an oblique strategy inspired design, each level splits aquascapes into three channels—left, right, and center—that players must navigate thoughtfully. Each channel represents different aspects of ocean life such as natural beauty, human impact, and ecological balance. Players match tiles depicting sea creatures, plants, and artificial debris. Completing puzzles cleans up channels, restores balance, and unlocks narratives about sustainability, encouraging players to consider ethical impacts on aquatic ecosystems. The game is designed for accessibility, catering to developers and players of varying skill levels, while weaving in messages about marine conservation and the importance of ethical interaction with nature.",
